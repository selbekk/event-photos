# Event photos (web)

This is the frontend part of the event photos application we're currently
creating a MVP for.

This app is currently being developed. More info will come once we have some to
share.

## Development

Setting this project up is pretty easy:

### Step 1: Download dependencies

    npm install

### Step 2: Run what tasks you want

    npm run build   # builds files
    npm run watch   # watches for changes
    npm start       # starts a local server @ localhost:4000
